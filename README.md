## 📑 Executive Summary
This project represents the **Final Exam** for the Data Analytics course at KEDGE Business School. The objective was to analyze a financial dataset to uncover profitability trends, sales performance by segment, and geographic distribution.

Using **Tableau**, I developed an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to visualize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across different markets and time periods.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

## 1. 🎯 Business Task (The Challenge)
The exam required a comprehensive analysis of the "Financial Sample" dataset to answer critical business questions:
1.  **Profitability:** Which countries and segments are generating the most profit?
2.  **Product Performance:** How do Sales and Profit compare across different products?
3.  **Trends:** What is the evolution of Sales over time (Yearly and Monthly)?

## 2. 🛠️ Analysis & Visualizations
*The following visualizations were created in Tableau as part of the practical examination.*

### 🌍 1. Global Profitability Analysis
**Task:** Analyze profitability by Country using a map visualization.
* **Insight:** The map highlights key performing regions, allowing for quick identification of high-margin markets vs. loss-making territories.
